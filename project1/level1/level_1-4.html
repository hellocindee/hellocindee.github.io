      On the radio, that's my favorite song
  <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
  <br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      Now the thrill is gone

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
  <br>  <br>

  Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
  <br>
  Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
  <br>
  Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
  <br>
  "My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
  <br>
  Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
  <br>
  Incompetent ain't the half of it
  <br>

  Saturdays with young lavishes
  <br>

  Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
  <br>

  These they took from the cabinet (woah)
  <br>

  Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
  <br>

  Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

  [Verse 2:]
  <br>


  I used to care what people thought
  <br>

  But now I care more
  <br>

  <br>ot it figured out
  <br>

  So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
  <br>

  Depending on whether or not it's worth it
  <br>

  So insecure, no one's perfect
  <br>

  We spend it, with no shame
  <br>

  We blow that, like Coltrane
  <br>

  We in here, like Rogain
  <br>

  Or leave it, like Cobain
  <br>
  And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
  <br>


  Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
  <br>
  And no matter where all of my friends go
  <br>
  Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
  <br>

  All of them people my kinfolk
  <br>
  At least I think so
  <br>
  Can't tell
  <br>
  Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
  <br>
  Cause they don't care
  <br>
  It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
  <br>
  Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
  <br>
  Labrador yapping
  <br>

  I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
  <br>
  Between us, I think there's something special
  <br>
  And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
  <br>

  Even if you don't understand, hold up
  <br>
