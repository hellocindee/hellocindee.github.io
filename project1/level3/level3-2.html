<h1>
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
<font size="10px">Till 3005, hold up</font size>
</h1></p>

<p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Hold up, wait a <h2>minute, all good just a week ago</h2>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
On the radio, that's my favorite song
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<font size="5px">Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long</font size>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Now the <h1><em><strong> thrill is gone</em></strong></h1>
</p>
<p>
Got <strong>no patience, cause I'm not a doctor</strong>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa</h3>
Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
<font size="4px"><em><br><br> God, <br>"you pay for your friends?" <br><br><br>
</em></font size>
I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays with young lavishes
<em>Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it</em>
These they took from the cabinet (woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
</p>
<p>
<stong>No<br>matter<br> what <br>you <br>say<br> or <br> what<br> you<br>do</strong>
<br><br><br><br>
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005
Hold up (hold up)
</p>
<p>
I used to care what people thought
But now I care more
I mean nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it, with no shame
We blow that, like Coltrane
We in here, like Rogain
Or leave it, like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
Can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care
<br><br><br>Assassins <br>are<br> stabbed<br> in<br> the<br> back<br> of<br> my<br> cabin
<strong><h3>Labrador yapping</stong></h3>
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
<h1>Between us, I think there's something special</h1>
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
</p>
<p>
We did it! Yay!
Nigga you so thirsty
