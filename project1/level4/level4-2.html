<strong><h1>No matter what you say or what you do
<br>
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
<br>
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
<br>
Till 3005, hold up</strong>
</h1>

<p>
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays with young lavishes
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005
Hold up (hold up)
</p>
<p><h3>
I used to care what people thought
<br><br><br>
But now I care more
<br><br><br>
I mean nobody out here's got it figured out
<br><br><br>
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
<br><br><br>
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
<br><br><br>
So insecure, no one's perfect
<br><br><br>
We spend it, with no shame
<br><br><br>
We blow that, like Coltrane
<br><br><br>
We in here, like Rogain
<br><br><br>
Or leave it, like Cobain
<br><br><br>
<h3>
</p>
<p>
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
</p>
<p>
<h4>
Can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
</h4>
</p>
<p>
We did it! Yay!
Nigga you so thirsty
