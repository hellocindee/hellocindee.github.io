  Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

  <em>Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
  On the radio, that's my favorite song</em>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
  Now the thrill is gone
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <em>Yeah, we spit that saliva, <strong><h2>iPhone</h2></strong> got message from Viber</em>
  Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
  "My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
  Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
  Incompetent ain't the half of it
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Saturdays with young lavishes
  Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
  These they took from the cabinet (woah)
  Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

  <h5>[Verse 2:]</h5>
  <br><br>
  I used to care what people thought
  But now I care more
  I mean nobody out here's got it figured out
  So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
  Depending on whether or not it's worth it
  So insecure, no one's perfect
  We spend it, with no shame
  We blow that, like Coltrane
  We in here, like Rogain

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or leave it, like Cobain
  And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song

  Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
  And no matter where all of my friends go
  Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
  All of them people my kinfolk
  At least I think so
  Can't tell
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <em>Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
  Cause they don't care</em>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
  Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
