    <h3><p class="firstparagraph">I worked on the rebranding for a local ice cream shop
      called "Mateo's." I chose this local shop because it happens to be one of my favorite
      places in Los Angeles and also the shop doesn't have a web presence.
    </h3>

    <p> For the Mateo's rebranding project it was really fun because well,
      I had to research desserts.
