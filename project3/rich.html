    <h3><p class="firstparagraph">When it Rains...it Pours, is a typographic book
    that is based on the word "rich." The book is made up of three different chapters
    which reflect different types of wealth, the bigger the typography the flashier
    that type of wealth is.</p class><br>

    <p><font color="white">The Process</font></p>
    <p>Creating the book required a lot of research, finding the right content, binding, size and typefaces.
      For this book I chose to bind it with a hardcover and book jacket, this type of binding was fitting for thead the concept
      of wealth.
