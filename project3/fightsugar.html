    <h3><p class="firstparagraph">"Fight Sugar" is a propaganda campaign
        based on the controvercial sugar tax in Northern California. I created
        the campign based on the concept of the popular Coca-Cola drink, and
        created posters, stickers and a blog to go along with it.

    <p>This project was fun to work on because I am passionate about health
      and I liked the idea of adding an addional tax on drinks that contained
      any artificial sweetners. I came up with the concept of "Don't drink yourself,
      fat California," and made a series of ten silk screen print posters.
