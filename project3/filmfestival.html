    <h3><p class="firstparagraph">"Soliders of Fortune" was a film festival that
      I created based on the films Lawless, Food Inc., and Nightcrawler. I designed
      four posters and shot a film festival trailer.

    <p><font color="white">The Process</font></p>
    <p>The process of this project was researching different films that had
      the same theme which was harder than I thought. After much research I selected
      Lawless, Food Inc. and Nightcrawler to be the featured films in my film festival.
