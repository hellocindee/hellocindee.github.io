    <p><font color="white">The Process</font></p>
    <p> The first step in the process was to read the novel "The Bell Jar"
      and after reading the book I needed to create a metaphor poster for a book
      reading of the book. The challenge of this project was that the book
      was dark which made it difficult to read and also made it diffuclt to design
      a cheerful and welcoming poster that would attract people to attend the event.
