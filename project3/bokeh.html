          <h3><p class="firstparagraph">Bokeh is a publication based on the Psychedelic art movement of the 1980s.
            I made the publication using mixed media to create bright and colorful
            compositions.</p class><br>

          <p>This has been my favorite project so far because it was challenging,
            and I was forced to work out of my comfort zone while using over 10 mediums.
            This was one of my first projects at OTIS and during the process I didn't think
            I would ever be able to finish because I felt stuck on the same idea. But after many iterations and
            compositions I was able to sucessfully complete my "Bokeh" publication.
