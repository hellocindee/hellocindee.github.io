      <h3><p class="firstparagraph">I redesigned the UCLA Department of Art website with my
        classmate Hana O'regan with the idea of making it more welcoming and easier to navigate.
        We focused on two target audiences, current students and prospective students which respectively
        different needs.

      <p> For the redesign we wanted the website to be connect with the user,
          whether the user attended the school or not. Hana and I had a clear
          memory of how stressful and time consuming it was to research colleges
          and nagiavte through their websites. Our goal was to help ease that stress
          with a simple yet sophisticated design.
