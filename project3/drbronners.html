    <h3><p class="firstparagraph">I created a mobile application for  Dr. Bronner's
        All Purpose Soap. The idea for the project was to create an app for the brand
        that would cater to an audience that is health concious,eco-frinedly and also economical.

    <p><font color="white">The Process</font></p>
    <p>The process for this project was different because it was my first
      advertising project and it was the first time I needed to research a target
      audinces, key personoas, wireframes, site maps and to design the actual app
      mock-up. The app was designed to offer tips and information about how to
      use Dr. Bronner's All Purpose Soap with an option to buy directly from the app.
