  No matter what you say or what you do
    <br><br><br>
  When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
    <br><br><br>
  Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
    <br><br><br>
  Till 3005, hold up
  <br><br><br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    [Verse 1:]
    <br><br><br>
  Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
    <br><br><br>
  Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
    <br><br><br>
  On the radio, that's my favorite song
    <br><br><br>
  Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
    <br><br><br>
  Now the thrill is gone
    <br><br><br>
  Got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
    <br><br><br>
  Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
    <br><br><br>
  Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
    <br><br><br>
  Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
    <br><br><br>
  Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
    <br><br><br>
  Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
    <br><br><br>
  "My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
    <br><br><br>
  Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
    <br><br><br>
  Incompetent ain't the half of it
    <br><br><br>
  Saturdays with young lavishes
    <br><br><br>
  Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
    <br><br><br>
  These they took from the cabinet (woah)
    <br><br><br>
  Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
    <br><br><br>
  Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
  <br><br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  [Hook x2:]
  <br><br><br>
  No matter what you say or what you do
    <br><br><br>
  When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
    <br><br><br>
  Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
  Till 3005
  <br><br><br>
  Hold up (hold up) [x8]
  <br><br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  [Verse 2:]
  <br><br><br>
  I used to care what people thought
  <br><br><br>
  But now I care more
  <br><br><br>
  I mean nobody out here's got it figured out
  <br><br><br>
  So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
  <br><br><br>
  Depending on whether or not it's worth it
  <br><br><br>
  So insecure, no one's perfect
  <br><br><br>
  We spend it, with no shame
  <br><br><br>
  We blow that, like Coltrane
  <br><br><br>
  We in here, like Rogain
  <br><br><br>
  Or leave it, like Cobain
  <br><br><br>
  And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
  <br><br><br>
  Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
  <br><br><br>
  And no matter where all of my friends go
  <br><br><br>
  Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
  <br><br><br>
  All of them people my kinfolk
  <br><br><br>
  At least I think so
  <br><br><br>
  Can't tell
  <br><br><br>
  Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
  <br><br><br>
  Cause they don't care
  <br><br><br>
  It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
  <br><br><br>
  Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
  <br><br><br>
  Labrador yapping
  <br><br><br>
  I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
  <br><br><br>
  Between us, I think there's something special
  <br><br><br>
  And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
  <br><br><br>
  Even if you don't understand, hold up
  <br><br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  [Hook x2]
  <br><br><br>

  [Outro:]
  <br><br><br>
  We did it! Yay!

  Nigga you so thirsty
